# Hello!

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer focused on good programming practices and UI/UX. I like and I want to think about business solutions that bring value to the product/service that I'm working on. You can reach me by [e-mail][email] or [Whatsapp][whatsapp].

## About me

Hi! My name is Ewerton and I'm a Brazilian full stack web developer. I'm interested in improve myself by helping people and solving problems. 

I like music and architecture as much as I like formal sciences and social sciences.

Currently I’m working as a freelancer and looking for a formal job.

In the future, I have plans to get deep into business or marketing, I’m also thinking about a Design graduation.

## Current Project

I'm building a website using 2 frameworks and 1 database. The backend is built in Django that creates a bridge between the Postgres database and the Next.js frontend.

In the Django side I’m using the Django Rest Framework to deliver a Rest API which will be consumed by the frontend. This Django application is covered by tests and I’m using the best practices to code it.

In the Next.js side I’m using Typescript. It has been a challenge since it's a technology that I've only known about for two weeks. I'm developing the layout using the Mobile First concept.

There’s more information on the repository (I’m currently writing the documentation).

You can access the Django Github repository in this [link][repo-web].

You can access the Next.js Github repository in this [link][repo-server].


# Education

I dropped out of college but still aspire to become a Computer Scientist. I'm reading
these books now:

- [Introdução à Programação com Python][python-book-1]
  (*Introduction to Programming with Python*)
- [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python][python-book-2]
- [Two Scoops of Django 3.x][django-book-1]
- [Lógica de Programação e Algoritmos com JavaScript][javascript-book-1]
  (*Programming Logic and Algorithms with JavaScript*)
- [Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms][javascript-book-2]
- [Grokking Algorithms][algorithms-book-1]
- [Getting Started with SQL][sql-book-1]
- [Expressões Regulares][regex-book-1]
  (*Regular Expressions*)
- [Becoming a Better Programmer][programming-book-1]


Dropping out of college was not an easy choice but it was better for me because I can efficiently manage the contents that I have to study and when I have to study them, unlike in college where the syllabuses were (apparently) disconnected from each other
